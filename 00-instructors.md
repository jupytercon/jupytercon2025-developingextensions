Jupyter Developer, OSS @ Anaconda

Iâ€™m a longtime Jupyter user and contributor, maintainer of Gator and JupyterLab-LaTeX, with hands-on work across JupyterLab, JupyterHub, and the wider ecosystem. I built a JupyterHub-based platform serving 300+ NIH researchers; worked on numerous JupyterLab extensions and recently built a community JupyterLab Marketplace (https://labextensions.dev/).
