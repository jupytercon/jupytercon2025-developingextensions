## Rosio Reyes ([`@RRosio`](https://github.com/rrosio))

**Software Engineer, OSS @ Anaconda**

I'm a contributor to the Jupyter ecosystem. I am currently working on extension development and testing for Gator (which provides environment and package management interface) and jupyter-fsspec (providing an interface for interacting with fsspec filesystems). I'm especially interested in building tools that are maintainable, well tested and contributor friendly. I enjoy working with others to improve the experience of developing in the Jupyter community.

I’m a longtime Jupyter user and contributor, maintainer of Gator and JupyterLab-LaTeX, with hands-on work across JupyterLab, JupyterHub, and the wider ecosystem. I built a JupyterHub-based platform serving 300+ NIH researchers; worked on numerous JupyterLab extensions and recently built a community JupyterLab Marketplace (https://labextensions.dev/).
