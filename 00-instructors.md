## Rosio Reyes ([`@RRosio`](https://github.com/rrosio))

**Software Engineer, OSS @ Anaconda**

I'm a contributor to the Jupyter ecosystem. I am currently working on extension development and testing for Gator (which provides environment and package management interface) and jupyter-fsspec (providing an interface for interacting with fsspec filesystems). I'm especially interested in building tools that are maintainable, well tested and contributor friendly. I enjoy working with others to improve the experience of developing in the Jupyter community.

**Jupyter Developer, OSS @ Anaconda**

I’m a longtime Jupyter user and contributor, maintainer of Gator and JupyterLab-LaTeX, with hands-on work across JupyterLab, JupyterHub, and the wider ecosystem. I built a JupyterHub-based platform serving 300+ NIH researchers; worked on numerous JupyterLab extensions and recently built a community JupyterLab Marketplace (https://labextensions.dev/).

**Jupyter Developer and Community Leader**

I'm a Jupyter contributor and maintainer, primarily in the JupyterLab and ipywidgets projects. I also serve on the
[Jupyter Executive Council](https://jupyter.org/about#executive-council-members),

**Research Software Engineer @ [Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment, UC Berkeley](https://dse.berkeley.edu/)**

I'm an open source contributor and maintainer with a background in geospatial data, the
cryosphere, and accessibility. I help maintain
[earthaccess](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/) to enable access to NASA data in 3
lines of code.
I'm also a community manager, leading the
[GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org/) project to make working with geospatial data more
approachable and enjoyable for all.
