# ðŸš¦ Prerequisites

## A laptop!

**If you're using Windows, we highly recommend coming prepared with Windows Subsystem for
Linux pre-configured.**
This workshop will use `bash` as its primary command language!


## [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)!

Git will enable you to version-control and share the extension you build on GitHub.


## A code editor / IDE

**And know how to use it!**

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a safe choice, but feel free to use your
favorite.


## Something to manage Python dependencies

**And know how to use it!**

We will provide commands, but you should be comfortable with the basics like creating
and activating virtual environments.

For example, [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/),
[conda/mamba](https://conda-forge.org/download/), or
[pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/).

If you're using conda, please
[configure `conda-forge` as your primary channel](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/transitioning_from_defaults/).
We recommend [replacing Anaconda/miniconda with Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/transitioning_from_defaults/#uninstalling-anaconda-and-installing-miniforge)
to avoid complications.
