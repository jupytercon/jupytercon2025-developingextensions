## 🌏 [JupyterGIS](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/)

JupyterGIS is a new extension which provides a JupyterLab-native Geographic Information
system (GIS) environment.

Its unique strengths are:

* Being JupyterLab-native, it can provide powerful two-way integrations serving
  Notebook-based geographic workflows.
* It's designed from the ground up to be real-time collaborative using
  [jupyter-collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-collaboration/).
* It supports [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/), so you can
  [use it in your browser without installing it](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/)!

`ipyaladin` and `jdaviz` are valuable tools for astronomy workflows in JupyterLab.

`ipyaladin` provides the [Aladin Sky Atlas](https://aladin.cds.unistra.fr/) as a
{term}`widget`.
It allows users to browse astronomical images, surveys, catalogues, and databases in an
interactive sky map.

`jdaviz` is a collection of astronomical tools which link interactive analysis and data
visualization.
