JupyterLab extensions are the key to customizing, enhancing, and scaling the
Jupyter experience, whether you‚Äôre integrating domain-specific tools, adding new
UI components or bridging frontend and backend workflows.

**In this hands-on workshop, we‚Äôll walk through the complete lifecycle of building
a JupyterLab extension, from scaffolding and plugin architecture to packaging
and publishing.**

Participants will be exposed to basic and advanced extension development
concepts: creating custom UI components, managing state and data, interfacing
with other frontend and server extensions, and publishing extensions on PyPI.
You‚Äôll come away with the building blocks needed to begin your journey in
developing extensions.

Together, we will create a basic extension from scratch, overview the landscape
of extensions, explore advanced extensions (for example, JupyterGIS, providing
real-time collaborative geospatial analysis in JupyterLab), and work on our own
new extensions or contribute to existing extensions.
After lunch we'll show you how to use AI to rapidly prototype, iterate on
complex features and ship production-ready extensions that solve real user
problems.

By the end, you'll have created multiple working extensions and the
knowledge to bring your own ideas to life, contributing to the vibrant Jupyter
ecosystem.
