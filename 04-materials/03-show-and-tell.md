## üåè [JupyterGIS](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/)

JupyterGIS is a new extension which provides a JupyterLab-native Geographic Information
system (GIS) environment.

Its unique strengths are:

* Being JupyterLab-native, it can provide powerful two-way integrations serving
  Notebook-based geographic workflows.
* It's designed from the ground up to be real-time collaborative using
  [jupyter-collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-collaboration/).
* It supports [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/), so you can
  [use it in your browser without installing it](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/)!


## üêä [gator](https://github.com/mamba-org/gator)

A user interface for managing Conda environments in JupyterLab (or standalone).


## üõí [JupyterLab Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.orbrx.io/)

An unofficial, community-run, searchable extensions catalog making it easier to discover
new extensions.
