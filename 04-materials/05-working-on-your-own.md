# üß© 5 - Working on your own extension

:::{important} Outcome
After completing this module, you will have:
- Selected and started work on a JupyterLab extension project that interests you
- Applied concepts from previous sessions to real-world extension development
- Connected with instructors and peers for guidance on your specific project
