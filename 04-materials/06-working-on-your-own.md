# üß© 6 - Working on your own extension

:::{important} Outcome
After completing this module, you will have:
- Selected and started work on a JupyterLab extension project that interests you
- Applied concepts from previous sessions to real-world extension development
- Connected with instructors and peers for guidance on your specific project
:::

:::{tip} Terms
TBD
:::


:::{note}
We will be using the [official template](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-template) as the starting point to creating your own extension.
:::

## üéØ Session Format
This is an **open exploration session** - similar to office hours or a study hall. You'll choose a project that interests you and work on it with instructor support. Don't worry about finishing - the goal is to practice the development workflow and problem-solving.

:::{tip} Choose Your Own Adventure
You have three paths:

1. **Build from Scratch** - Create a new extension using the template and AI assistance
2. **Contribute to Existing Extensions** - Add features or fix issues in established projects

All paths are valuable! Pick what excites you most.
:::

## Path 1: Build your own extension from scratch

Create something entirely new using the extension template, AI assistance, and the patterns you've learned.

### Quick start

Follow these sections from chapter 2 to start a new extension from a template:

1. [üõ†Ô∏è Setup](02-anatomy-of-extensions.md#Ô∏è-setup) - Set up your environment, Git, and GitHub repository
2. [üèãÔ∏è Exercise A: Extension creation and development loop](02-anatomy-of-extensions.md#Ô∏è-exercise-a-15-minutes-extension-creation-and-development-loop) - Create your extension from the template and test the development loop

Once you have your extension set up and working, return here to choose an inspiration project below.

### Inspiration

The following three examples with prompts have been tested and confirmed working. Pick one that matches your interests - whether you want visual effects, creative customization, or full-stack development. Use them as-is to practice prompt engineering, or as inspiration for your own ideas.

#### üéâ Confetti celebration button

#### üé® Custom theme extension

#### üìä CPU monitor widget

### More extension ideas

Pick an idea that matches your comfort level and interests:

#### Beginner (frontend only)
1. **Theme switcher dropdown**: Add a quick theme selector to the toolbar for easy switching
2. **Clock widget**: Status bar item showing current time with configurable timezone
3. **Quote of the day**: Main area widget that fetches and displays random quotes
4. **Keyboard shortcut viewer**: Panel showing all available shortcuts
5. **Custom welcome screen**: Override the default launcher with your own design
6. **Pomodoro timer**: Status bar timer for focused work sessions with notifications

#### Intermediate (frontend + server)
1. **File size analyzer**: Scan workspace directory and show largest files/folders
2. **Git status widget**: Display current branch, uncommitted changes count
3. **Environment inspector**: Show installed packages and Python/Node versions
4. **Todo list with persistence**: Sidebar panel that saves tasks to disk

#### Advanced
2. **AI code assistant**: Create a chat with LLM
3. **Performance profiler**: Instrument notebook cells and show execution metrics
4. **Custom file format viewer**: Add support for viewing proprietary file types
5. **Real-time log viewer**: Stream and filter server logs in a widget

### üí° More ideas from JupyterLab community

## Path 2: Contribute to existing extensions

Contributing to established extensions is a great way to learn real-world patterns and give back to the community.

### Why contribute?

- Learn from production-quality code
- Work with maintainers who know JupyterLab well
- Your contribution helps thousands of users
- Build your portfolio and resume
- Connect with the Jupyter community

## Path 3: Explore and experiment
