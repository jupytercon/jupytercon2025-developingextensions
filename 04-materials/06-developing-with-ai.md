# ðŸ¤– Developing extensions with AI assistance

::::{hint} Learning objectives
- Use an AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) to build and modify JupyterLab extensions by writing effective prompts with context, constraints, and acceptance criteria; point AI to official docs/APIs and require citations
- Generate and refine extension code (TypeScript/React UI, commands, settings schemas, Python endpoints) with AI guidance; run build/lint/tests and interpret errors to request focused fixes
- Configure and customize a local AI ruleset (AGENTS.md) for your development workflow; understand privacy, licensing, and safety considerations when sharing code with AI tools
::::

::::{tip} Outcome
After this module, you will have:
- Configured a local development environment with AI tools and the AGENTS.md ruleset; created a reproducible prompt checklist/playbook with doc/API citations
- Either created a new extension from the template with at least one user-visible feature, or contributed a meaningful enhancement to an existing extension; shipped it by publishing to PyPI/GitHub or opening a PR with passing tests
- Confidence to continue exploring extension ideas primarily by prompting, while being able to understand and edit the generated code
